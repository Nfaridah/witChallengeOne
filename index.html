                <h4>The Language</h4>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language for computers. 
                    It is often run in web browser applications to create things that work by themselves 
                    like a pop up message or a live clock. 
                    It is not related to the programming language Java. <br>
                    <br />
                    Although Java and JavaScript have many exernal similarities such as as name and syntax, 
                    the two languages follow different design principles
                </p>
                <h4>Brief History</h4>
                <p>
                    JavaScript was developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a Netscape communications corporation programer.
                    It took Eich only 10 days to develop the scripting language then known as Mocha but quickly became
                    known as LiveScript. The team changed the name to JavaScript to reflect Netscape's support of Java
                    within its browser. At the time however, people said it was a marketing tactic to connect a brand
                    new language(JavaScript) to a then popular language (java) regardless of the fact that the two have 
                    little in comon. JavaScript was created to fill the need of a glue language to put together components
                    and automate interactions. By the time the browser world shifted and Internet Explorer became the
                    dominant web browser, JavaScript evolved into the endorsed standard for writing interactive processes
                    that run in a web browser.

            <h3><a name="V&A"></a>Variables and Arrays</h3>
            <div id=Variables_and_Arrays align="justify">
                <h4>Variables</h4>
                <p>
                    A variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data values which 
                    can be changed at anytime. JavaScript uses reserved keyword 'var' to declare a variable. A variable must 
                    have a unique name. An '=' sign is used as an assignment operator to assignment operator to assign to assign
                    a value to our variable when we declare it or before we use it.
                </p>
                <p id="cd">
                <code>
                    var name = "faridah"; <br>
                    var age = 30; <br>
                    <br />
                    //the variables are name & age, while the assigned values are faridah and 30 respectively
                </code>
                </p>

                <h4>Arrays</h4>
                <p>
                    An array is a special variable that holds more than one value at a time under a single name. values in an 
                    array can be accessed by reffering to an index number in an array. The first value in an array always holds
                    the index 0 and so on. An array is also declared by the key word 'var' and is denoted by box brackets '[]'
                </p>
                <p id="cd">
                <code>
                    var name = ["faridah", "Zena", "Zam"] <br>
                    var age = [30, 25, 20] <br>
                    <br />
                    //the index is reffered to by specifying the number in the brackets e.g. <br> 
                    name[0] will be faridah and age[2] will be 20.
                </code>

            <div id=Operators_and_Expressions align="justify">
                <h4>Operators</h4>
                <p>
                    Operators are used to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words,
                    we can say that an operator operates the operands. In JavaScript, operators are used to compare values, perform
                    arithmetic operations etc. There are various operators supported by Javascript including;
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
                        <li>Comparison Operators</li>
                        <li>Logical Operators</li>
                        <li>Assignment operators</li>
                        <li>Ternary Operators</li>
                        <li>typeof Operators</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>In our code example, we will be focusing on arithmetic operators</p>
                <p id="cd">
                <code>
                    a = 3 + 1 gives a = 4 <br>// "+" Adds operands <br>
                    <br />
                    b = 8 - 6 gives b = 2 <br>// "-" Subtracts operands <br>
                    <br />
                    c = 2 * 4 gives c = 8 <br>// "*" Multiplies operands <br>
                    <br />
                    d = 6 / 3 gives d = 2 <br>// "/" Divides operands <br>
                    <br />
                    e = 7 % 2 gives e = 1 <br>// "%" Gives the modulus of operands <br>
                    <br />
                    f = a++ gives f = 5 <br>// "++" Increases the value of an integer by 1 <br>
                    <br />
                    g = b-- gives g = 1 <br>// "--" Decreases the value of an integer by 1 <br>
                </code>
                </p>

                <h4>Expressions</h4>
                <p>
                    An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value. Every syntactically valid expression
                    resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions:
                    those that assign a value to a variable e.g. <code> g = 1 // uses "=" to assign the value 1 to variable g</code> & those that evaluate and reslove to a 
                    value e.g. <code> 3 * 7 //  * multiplies operands without assigning the value to a variable</code>
                    Javascript has the followinng expression category;
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arithmetic: Uses arithmetic operators and evaluates to a number e.g. <code> 5 + 1 </code></li>
                        <li>String: Uses string operators and evaluates to a character string e.g. <code> "hello" + "world" </code> </li>
                        <li>Llogical: Uses logical operators and evaluates to true or false</li>  
                        <li>Primary Expressions: Uses basic keywords and general expressions in Javascript</li>
                        <li>Left-hand-side: Left values are the destination of an assignment</li>       
                    </ul>
                <p>Our code example will focus on left-hand-side expressions</p>
                <p id="cd">
                <code>
                    var object = new object1([param1, param 2, param 3]);<br>
                    //"new" operator creates an instance of an object<br>
                    <br />
                    super.functionOnParent([arguments]);<br>

            <h3><a name="PCF"></a>Program Control Flow</h3>
            <div id=Program_Control_Flow align="justify">
                <p>
                    Peogram control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
                    The code is run in order from the first line in file to the last line , unless the
                    computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops <br>
                    <br />
                    For Example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits
                    validated data, but if the user leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in.
                    To do this, the script uses a conditional structiure or <code>if...else</code>, so that different code
                    executes depending on whether the form is coplete or not as seen below
                </p>

            <h3><a name="I&O"></a>Input and Output</h3>
            <div id=Input_and_Output align="justify">
                    <p>
                        Input in JavaScript is how the program receives the data that it works with to complete tasks and
                        Output is how it gives us the feedback . The ways that data can be entered into a program
                        and their respective output styles can be seen below,
                    </p>

                    <h4>Hard Coding</h4>
                    <p>Here, the program gets the input to work with from the code itself e.g.</p>
                    
                    <p id="cd">
                    <code> 
                        username = "faridah"; //input<br>
                        document.write(username); //output<br>
                        <br />
                        //Here, the input is explicitly given in the code and the program will work with it as is
                    </code>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Implicit</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is similar to hard coding with the exception that the value of the variable isnt explicitly given.
                        The variable can take on values that are implied from elsewhere in the program. function parameters are a good example 
                        for this type
                    </p>
                    <p id="cd">
                    <code>
                        function age(age1, age2){<br>
                            totalAge = age1 + age2;<br>
                            average = totalAge / 2;<br>
                        } <br>
                        age (26, 18); //from this line going up is input<br>
                        console.log(average); //output<br>
                        <br />
                        //In the example above, age can take on different values as preffered by the user and the function will work with those
                    </code>
                    </p>

                    <h4>User prompt</h4>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript being the language of interaction, this is the most common input type. In this, the user of the program is asked
                        to provide the data that the program uses to complete the set task. Lets look at it below;
                    </p>
                    <p id="cd">
                    <code>
                        prompt(message, default) //the message parameter holds the instruction while default holds an example of the input<br>                      
                        <br />
                        var username = window.prompt("Enter your name", ""); //input<br>
                        alert("You are welcome " + "username"); //output
                    </code>
